> 各位记者朋友，大家上午好。首先我还是要向在座的女记者们和所有的女同胞们致以节日的祝福。同时借此机会向所有关心支持中国外交的中外记者们表示我们的感谢，因为中国外交取得的成绩当中有大家付出的一份辛劳和贡献。大家辛苦了！现在我愿意回答大家的问题。

> 谢谢主持人，外长，您好。党的十八大以来，外交工作取得了前所未有的重要成就，也赢得了全国人民的一致点赞。我们知道，2018年是十九大之后的开局之年，今年中国外交有哪些亮点，能否请您给我们介绍一下？谢谢。
> 
> 王毅（2018-03-08 10:08:04）
> 
> 党的十八大以来，在以习近平同志为核心的党中央的正确领导之下，我们确实走出了一条具有中国特色、中国气派、中国风格的大国外交之路，为维护国家主权和人民利益、为服务国内改革开放大局发挥了重要作用，取得了历史性的成就。
> 
> 王毅（2018-03-08 10:09:01）
> 
> 去年10月份，习近平总书记在中共十九大报告当中强调，我们要同各国一道共同建设新型国际关系，共同构建人类命运共同体，这就是新时代中国大国外交的目标。
> 
> 王毅（2018-03-08 10:11:10）
> 
> 2018年是贯彻落实十九大精神的开局之年，中国外交将在习近平新时代中国特色社会主义思想指引下，拿出新作为、展现新气象。今年的中国外交亮点主要体现在四大主场活动上。
> 
> 王毅（2018-03-08 10:13:21）
> 
> 一是4月在海南举行博鳌亚洲论坛年会，主旋律是改革开放。今年恰逢中国改革开放40周年，本届年会将总结改革开放成功经验，展示新时代深化改革、扩大开放的新前景。
> 
> 王毅（2018-03-08 10:13:46）
> 
> 二是6月在青岛举行上海合作组织峰会，主旋律是弘扬“上海精神”。扩员后的上合组织将重温互信、互利、平等、协商、尊重多样文明、谋求共同发展的“上海精神”，开启上合组织发展壮大的新征程。
> 
> 王毅（2018-03-08 10:14:18）
> 
> 三是9月在北京举行中非合作论坛峰会。主旋律是“一带一路”。非洲各国的兄弟姐妹将会以这次峰会为契机，全方位参与“一带一路”建设，为中非全面战略伙伴关系注入新动力。
> 
> 王毅（2018-03-08 10:14:47）
> 
> 四是11月在上海首次举行中国国际进口博览会，主旋律是市场开放。中国将向世界张开双臂，展现市场潜力，欢迎各国参与和分享中国发展的新机遇。
> 
> 王毅（2018-03-08 10:15:20）
> 
> 总之，2018年中国外交的大幕已经拉开，新时代的中国外交将为中国自身发展营造更好外部环境，也为人类进步事业提供更多正能量。谢谢。

> 中国一直高度重视朝美的直接谈判，请问中国在这方面可以发挥什么作用？为了实现半岛长治久安，中方是否认为美方应该撤离驻韩美军？
> 
> 王毅（2018-03-08 10:18:16）
> 
> 这是一个当前国际社会最关注的话题，我们看到朝韩双方抓住冬奥会的契机开展了一系列密集互动，南北关系迅速解冻，这为冰封已久的半岛形势注入了一股久违的暖流。发生这样的变化有人似乎感到困惑，但其实是情理当中。我们看到冬奥会期间，朝鲜并没有进行新的核导实验，美国、韩国也暂停了针对朝鲜的军演。事实证明，中方提出的“双暂停”倡议是一剂对症下药的良方，为南北改善关系营造了最基本的条件。
> 
> 王毅（2018-03-08 10:18:49）
> 
> 现在，半岛问题的解决终于朝着正确方向迈出了重要一步。我们对朝韩双方为此做出的努力予以充分肯定和支持。接下来的关键，是各方积极呼应、形成合力，共同把半岛局势重新纳入到和平的轨道，把半岛核问题重新纳入到对话解决的轨道。为此我们呼吁各方，尤其是美朝双方尽快进行接触和对话，各方沿着“双轨并进”的思路，既坚持无核化目标，又积极构建半岛和平机制，在推进无核化的进程中同步对等解决各方包括朝鲜方面的合理安全关切。这既是中方的一贯立场，也是联合国安理会决议所确定的目标。
> 
> 王毅（2018-03-08 10:19:28）
> 
> 我还要说的是，冰冻三尺非一日之寒。尽管隧道的尽头已经显露曙光，但是前行的道路不可能一帆风顺。历史经验告诉我们，每当半岛局势出现缓和时，各种干扰就会如影随形、接踵而至，现在又到了检验各方是不是真心希望解决半岛核问题的关键时刻。和平必须争取，机遇需要把握。各方应以半岛和平大局为重，以本地区人民安危为重，拿出政治勇气，做出政治决断，尽快开展一切必要和有益的双多边接触，全力推动重启和平解决半岛核问题的对话谈判。中方将为此继续做出我们的努力。谢谢。
> 
> 中央电视台记者（2018-03-08 10:22:47）
> 
> 请问外长的是，这些年中国民众普遍有一个深切的体会，就是自从十八大以来，习近平总书记亲力亲为开展元首外交，引领树立起了新时代的中国形象，展现了领袖风范，同时推动中国国际地位和影响得到了历史性的提升。所以想在这里请教外长，您是怎么看待中国元首外交的重要作用和影响的？谢谢。
> 
> 王毅（2018-03-08 10:23:19）
> 
> 元首外交是国际交往的最高形态，有着其他交往无法替代的重要作用和战略价值。党的十八大以来，习近平主席作为中国特色大国外交的总设计师，亲自擘画和推进了精彩纷呈的元首外交。习主席遍访世界57个国家，接待了110多位外国元首访华，这些重大的外交行动不仅极大增进了国际社会对中国的了解，有效提升了中国的国际地位和影响，也为解决当今许多全球性问题指明了方向。而习主席本人的领袖风范和人格魅力，也使很多不同社会制度、不同文化背景的领导人都成为了他的好朋友，成为了中国的好朋友。
> 
> 王毅（2018-03-08 10:24:04）
> 
> 2018年，除了主持四大主场活动之外，习主席还将赴南非、巴布亚新几内亚和阿根廷出席金砖国家领导人峰会、亚太经合组织领导人非正式会议以及二十国集团领导人会晤。我们相信，习主席亲力亲为的元首外交将会进一步展现为人民谋福、为国家负责、为世界担当的博大情怀，书写新时代中国特色大国外交的崭新篇章。谢谢。
> 
> 彭博社记者（2018-03-08 10:25:21）
> 
> 您好，美国总统特朗普说，他愿意采取一切工具来防止中国的国有经济模式破坏国际竞争，那么请问，中国是否也愿意采取一切工具来反击？如果是的话，中国将会采取哪些工具呢？谢谢。
> 
> 王毅（2018-03-08 10:28:13）
> 
> 你这个问题本身就很有攻击性，当然我认为你主要还是要问中美之间的关系。作为外长，我有责任首先就我们的对美政策再做一次明确的重申。中美双方达成的重要的共识是很多的，我们都认为中美在维护世界和平、稳定、繁荣方面拥有广泛共同利益和重要责任，双方将在互利互惠基础上拓展各领域合作，在相互尊重基础上管控好分歧矛盾，加强两国人民之间的相互了解与友谊，合作应对重大地区和全球性挑战，推动中美关系持续、健康和稳定发展。
> 
> 王毅（2018-03-08 10:28:32）
> 
> 中美之间主要是合作，两国人民之间有着非常广泛和密切的交往，我来这之前看到一个美国民调的最新数字，这个数字表明美国民众对中国的好感度超过了50%，是近30年来最高的数字，而且近年来在不断地提高。我希望记者朋友们在看到问题的时候，也要看到这些积极因素的生长。
> 
> 王毅（2018-03-08 10:30:19）
> 
> 作为世界上最大的发展中国家和最大的发达国家，中美合作将造福两国，也将惠及世界。如果说中美之间有竞争的话，那也应该是良性和积极竞争，这在国际交往当中也是很正常的。换句话说，中美可以有竞争，不必做对手，更需当伙伴。
> 
> 王毅（2018-03-08 10:30:56）
> 
> 中国将继续坚持走自己选择的发展道路，中国的发展振兴不可阻挡，这已成为国际社会的普遍认知。美国一些人认为中国因此要取代美国在国际上的作用，这是一个根本性的战略误判。我们走的是中国特色社会主义道路，核心要义是坚持和平发展，成功之处在于合作共赢。这与传统大国曾经走过的路是完全不同的，而且正在得到越来越多国家的认同和欢迎。也就是说中国越发展，越能为世界做贡献。当然，中国实现自身现代化的道路还很长，我们不会也不必去取代美国的作用。中美双方应该在遵守中美三个联合公报和双方各项共识基础上相互尊重、优势互补、互利共赢。中美关系数十年历经风雨，但是对话与合作始终是主线，因为这是唯一明智也是现实的选择。
> 
> 王毅（2018-03-08 10:33:19）
> 
> 大家关心中美的贸易摩擦。我想告诉大家的是，历史的经验教训证明，打贸易战从来都不是解决问题的正确途径。尤其在全球化的今天，选择贸易战更是抓错了药方，结果只会损人害己，中方必将做出正当和必要的反应。作为两个利益高度融合的大国，作为世界第一和第二大经济体，中美既要对两国人民负责，也要对世界各国负责。我们还是希望双方心平气和地坐下来，通过平等和建设性对话，共同找出一个互利双赢的解决办法。谢谢。
> 
> 中国日报记者（2018-03-08 10:34:29）
> 
> 在过去的一年中我们看到，中方就若开邦问题在缅甸和孟加拉国之间进行了斡旋，我们也看到去年在北京举行了巴以和平人士座谈会，中方首次举办了中阿巴外长对话。现在有评论猜测说，中国一改过去不干涉内政的原则，并将在未来更多干预别国和地区事务。请问这是否是中国外交的新趋势？谢谢。
> 
> 王毅（2018-03-08 10:36:40）
> 
> 作为联合国安理会常任理事国，中国始终把维护国际和平作为自己应尽的责任。早在上世纪50年代，我们就为和平解决印度支那问题作出过重要贡献，而今天的中国，更应为解决地区和国际热点问题积极发挥作用。这既是我们应该做的，也是各方的普遍期待。
> 
> 王毅（2018-03-08 10:37:23）
> 
> 中国参与解决热点问题有着鲜明的中国特色，始终坚持有所为也有所不为。归纳起来有三条，就是和平性、正当性和建设性。和平性就是坚持政治解决方向，主张通过对话谈判解决任何矛盾分歧，坚决反对使用武力；正当性就是坚持不干涉内政原则，尊重当事国的主权和意愿，坚决反对强加于人；建设性就是坚持客观公正立场，根据事情本身的是非曲直来斡旋调停，坚决反对谋取私利。这三个特色来源于中国优秀的文化传统，植根于中国外交的成功实践，符合联合国宪章的宗旨和原则，也为解决当今世界各种冲突和挑战提供了正确导向和积极借鉴。谢谢。

> 今日俄罗斯国际通讯社记者（2018-03-08 10:40:45）
> 
> 外长好。俄罗斯大选将于3月18日举行，您对此有什么预期？在此背景下，我还想提一个关于中俄关系的问题。近年来，各方对俄罗斯及其国际地位看法不一，俄罗斯受到严厉批评和经济制裁。与此同时，中国已成为世界第二大经济体，各方认为中国将在国际政治中取代美国的领导地位，请问中国如何看待俄罗斯和中俄关系的发展？
> 
> 王毅（2018-03-08 10:41:30）
> 
> 俄罗斯总统选举是俄罗斯国家和人民的大事。我们看到，在普京总统的领导之下，近年来俄罗斯的国家发展取得了重要成就，普京总统始终得到了俄罗斯人民的坚定支持。我们相信，俄罗斯人民一定会再次做出正确的选择，俄罗斯民族也一定会在国家振兴道路上继续阔步前行。俄罗斯是一个有韧性、有坚持，也能抗压的民族，我们祝福俄罗斯，也祝福俄罗斯人民。
> 
> 王毅（2018-03-08 10:42:01）
> 
> 至于中俄关系，我们对中俄关系的前景始终充满信心，我们的信心来自于两国元首结下的深厚友谊和互信，这将是继续引领两国关系发展的根本保障。我们的信心还来自于双方各领域务实合作的不断深化；来源于在彼此核心利益上坚定的相互支持；也来自于在国际事务当中的密切协作以及两国各界日益频繁的交流往来。总之，中俄全面战略协作伙伴关系稳如泰山。请你向俄罗斯的朋友们转达一句话：中俄深化合作没有止境，中俄关系没有最好只有更好。谢谢。

> 环球时报记者（2018-03-08 10:44:05）
> 
> 外长好。近年来中国在各个领域的影响力都在不断地上升，尤其是十九大之后国人对于未来更是充满了期待。但是我们也同时注意到，在国际上开始了新一轮“中国威胁论”的炒作，比如说认为中国正在用“锐实力”影响世界等等。请问您对此有何回应？谢谢。
> 
> 王毅（2018-03-08 10:44:25）
> 
> 过去几十年，西方一直在对中国作出各种评判和预测，归纳起来无非一种是“中国崩溃论”，一种是“中国威胁论”。随着中国的持续发展，“中国崩溃论”自己先崩溃了，变成了一个国际笑柄。“中国威胁论”虽然有了新的翻版，但却更加不得人心。因为事实胜于雄辩。
> 
> 王毅（2018-03-08 10:46:01）
> 
> 事实是什么？那就是：中国是全球经济增长的主要贡献者，年均贡献率达到30%以上，超过了美国、日本以及欧元区国家的总和；中国是全球减贫事业的主要贡献者，贡献率超过了70%，创造了人类历史上的奇迹；中国还是维护世界和平的主要贡献者，我们成为联合国安理会五个常任理事国当中派出维和人员最多的国家，维和经费出资居世界第二位。
> 
> 王毅（2018-03-08 10:50:03）
> 
> 对于这些事实，只要不怀有偏见，不奉行双重标准，从中看到的绝不是什么威胁，而是满满的机遇。所谓“中国威胁论”可以休矣。谢谢。
> 
> 哈萨克斯坦国际通讯社记者（2018-03-08 10:50:25）
> 
> 我的问题是关于“一带一路”倡议。习主席宣布“一带一路”倡议以来，到2018年已过去5年，现在包括哈萨克斯坦在内的许多国家都将“一带一路”倡议与自己的国家发展战略对接，但我们也感到个别西方人也对倡议的目的、实现方式、透明度以及是否符合国际规则有疑虑。请问，未来5年的“一带一路”倡议会如何发展？如何回应对该倡议的疑虑？
> 
> 王毅（2018-03-08 10:51:28）
> 
> “一带一路”是中国提出的阳光倡议，共商、共建、共享是推进“一带一路”的黄金法则，这六个字决定了“一带一路”合作具有鲜明的平等性、开放性和普惠性。也就是说，无论是规划合作蓝图还是实施具体项目，都由参与方商量着办，一切都在阳光下运作。没有一家独大，而是各方平等参与；没有暗箱操作，而是坚持公开透明；没有赢者通吃，而是谋求互利共赢。
> 
> 王毅（2018-03-08 10:55:06）
> 
> 去年5月，140多个国家的代表出席“一带一路”国际合作高峰论坛，这是国际社会对“一带一路”投出的“信任票”和“支持票”。迄今已有80多个国家和国际组织同中方签署了共建“一带一路”合作协议，一大批合作项目正在全面地推进，为当地经济社会发展发挥了“雪中送炭”的作用。我举几个例子，比如中国在巴基斯坦开工建设的十几座电站，将彻底解决巴国内缺电限电的历史困境，仅其中一座电站就满足了上千万民众的日常需求。中国企业收购陷入困境的塞尔维亚钢厂，不到一年就扭亏为盈，不仅保住了5000多人的就业，还使整个城市浴火重生。中国企业接手希腊最大港口的经营，货物吞吐量迅速回升，重新跻身欧洲大港行列。中国和法国联手在英国建设核电站，成为“一带一路”高新技术项目合作的典范。
> 
> 王毅（2018-03-08 10:56:22）
> 
> “一带一路”是全球公共产品，当然遵守国际规则；“一带一路”是国际合作平台，自然按照市场规律行事。去年高峰论坛发表的联合公报已经对此做出了公开承诺，强调要统筹好经济、社会、金融和环境之间的关系，增强项目的可持续性。我们真诚欢迎各方为“一带一路”建言献策，共同把“一带一路”建设好、推进好，不仅加强各国基础设施的“硬联通”，也要开展政策、规则和标准的“软联通”；不仅接地气，还要高标准；不仅效益好，而且高质量；不仅惠及中国，更要造福世界。谢谢。
> 
> 北京电视台记者（2018-03-08 10:58:42）
> 
> 外长，您好。前几天，李克强总理在政府工作报告报告中指出，今年是全面贯彻党的十九大精神的开局之年，是改革开放40周年，是决胜全面建成小康社会、实施“十三五”规划承上启下的关键一年。您曾经多次强调，服务国家发展始终是中国外交的中心任务。我想更多了解一下，今年外交部在这方面还会有哪些举措？谢谢。
> 
> 王毅（2018-03-08 10:59:06）
> 
> 中国仍是发展中国家，服务国内发展是中国特色大国外交分内的事。面对新的历史使命和时代要求，外交部将按照中央的统一部署，更加积极有为地做好服务国内发展这篇大文章。
>

> 
> 王毅（2018-03-08 11:05:03）
> 
> 我们将破解新课题，紧扣社会主要矛盾变化，打造地方省区市全球推介活动的增强版。我们还将创办反映重大改革开放举措的专题推介，更有针对性地讲好中国故事。比如今年我们将向全球推介雄安新区。扶贫工作外交部也从不缺位，将为打赢扶贫攻坚战贡献一份力量。

> 我们还将落实新要求，发挥好外交部和驻外机构遍布全球的优势，为“一带一路”建设铺路架桥，维护好我们国家的海外利益。
> 
> 王毅（2018-03-08 11:05:37）

> 
> 2018年，我们将继续把东盟放在对外合作议程的首页，打造更高水平的战略伙伴关系，构建更紧密的命运共同体。我们将推进三项重点工作。一是规划新蓝图。我们将和东盟一起制定《中国-东盟战略伙伴关系2030年愿景》，实现“一带一路”倡议和东盟发展规划更好的对接。二是培育新亮点，在政治安全、经贸、社会人文三大支柱之下开辟更多合作领域，增加更多的合作项目，取得更多合作成果。三是打造新高地，进一步培育澜湄流域经济发展带，构建同东盟东部增长区的合作框架。我们将继续支持东盟共同体建设，推动区域全面经济伙伴关系协定早日达成。谢谢。

> 王毅（2018-03-08 11:30:30）
> 
> 中印关系保持着发展势头，也经历了困难和考验。在此过程中，中方既坚定维护了自身的正当权益，也积极顾全了中印关系的大局。对于中印关系的发展前景，两国领导人已经达成了重要战略共识，那就是中印要龙象共舞，而不是龙象争斗；中印1+1不仅等于2，更等于11。

> 面对当前国际局势的百年变局，越来越多的有识之士认识到，两个超过10亿人口规模的发展中大国相继走向现代化，最重要的是相互理解、相互支持，最应该避免的是相互猜忌、相互消耗。从这个意义上讲，中印之间迫切需要解决的问题就是互信。建立起政治互信，喜马拉雅山也阻挡不了相互加强友好交往。缺乏互信，一马平川也难使双方走到一起。我要告诉印度朋友的是，中印之间共识远多于分歧，利益远大于摩擦。中方愿意同印度继承和弘扬友好传统，同印度人民交朋友、做伙伴。希望双方打开心结，相向而行，用信任代替猜忌，以对话管控分歧，靠合作开创未来。谢谢。

> 中国没有参加CPTPP协定。但中国历来是贸易自由化的坚定支持者，也是亚太区域合作和经济一体化的重要参与方。2014年，正是在中国推动下，亚太经合组织领导人非正式会议在北京正式启动了亚太自贸区进程，而中国正在积极参与的区域全面经济伙伴关系，也就是RCEP，是目前正在商谈的覆盖人口最多、成员构成最广的自贸安排。不管是RCEP还是CPTPP，只要顺应亚太区域经济一体化方向，符合透明、开放、包容原则，有利于维护以WTO为核心的全球自由贸易体系，中方都持积极态度。当然，我们也希望亚太地区各种不同的自贸安排能够彼此沟通协调，形成良性互动，从各自角度为抵制贸易保护主义、构建开放型世界经济发挥建设性作用。谢谢。

> Foreign Minister Wang Yi Meets the Press
> 2018/03/09
> 
> 
> On 8 March 2018, the First Session of the Thirteenth National People's Congress held a press conference. Foreign Minister Wang Yi answered questions on China's foreign policy and external relations.
> 
> Wang Yi: Dear members of the press, good morning. At the outset, I wish to extend festive greetings to all women, particularly the female journalists in this room. I also wish to thank the press, Chinese and foreign, for having shown understanding and support for China's foreign policy and external relations. Everything we have accomplished, you have played a part. Thank you! Now I am ready to take your questions.
> 
> 
> 
> People's Daily: Since the 18th National Congress of the Communist Party of China, China has made unprecedented progress in its foreign relations, which is widely praised across the country. Following the 19th Party Congress, what will be the highlights of China's diplomatic agenda this year?
> 
> Wang Yi: Under the outstanding leadership of the CPC Central Committee with Comrade Xi Jinping at its core since the 18th Party Congress, we have traveled on a road of major-country diplomacy that reflects China's distinct vision, style and values. Producing historic accomplishments, our diplomatic efforts have been instrumental to upholding national sovereignty and interests, and to facilitating domestic reform and development. Last October, General Secretary Xi Jinping emphasized in his report to the 19th Party Congress that China will work with other countries to foster a new type of international relations and to build a global community with a shared future. This is the aim of China's major-country diplomacy in the new era.
> 
> The year 2018 kicks off efforts to implement the decisions of the 19th Party Congress. Guided by Xi Jinping Thought on Socialism with Chinese Characteristics for a New Era, we in the diplomatic service will take new steps and make new strides. The main highlights of China's diplomatic calendar will include the following four events we are going to host:
> 
> First, the Boao Forum for Asia Annual Conference, which will take place in Hainan this April and focus on reform and opening-up. In this 40th anniversary year of reform and opening-up, we will review China's successful experience and sketch new possibilities for reform and opening-up in the new era.
> 
> Second, the Shanghai Cooperation Organization Summit, which will take place in Qingdao this June and focus on revitalizing the Shanghai Spirit. The expanded SCO will rededicate itself to the Shanghai Spirit of mutual trust and benefit, equal-footed consultation, respect for diversity of civilizations and pursuit of common development. The summit will set the SCO on a new journey of consolidation and growth.
> 
> Third, the Forum on China-Africa Cooperation Summit, which will take place in Beijing this September and focus on the Belt and Road Initiative. A great opportunity for our African brothers and sisters to participate fully in the BRI, the Summit will give new impetus to the China-Africa comprehensive strategic partnership.
> 
> Fourth, the first China International Import Expo, which will take place in Shanghai this November and focus on further market opening. China will embrace the world with open arms and enormous market potential. All will be welcome to access and benefit from the new opportunities of China's development.
> 
> China's diplomatic agenda for 2018 are unfolding even as we speak. In the new era, we will work even harder to see that China will enjoy a better environment for development and make greater contributions to human progress.
> 
> 		
> Reuters: What role does China have to facilitate direct talks between North Korea and the United States? Does China believe that the US needs to withdraw its military forces in South Korea?
> 
> Wang Yi: This is the hottest topic right now. Seizing the opportunity of the PyeongChang Olympics, the DPRK and the ROK have had a succession of interactions and achieved a rapid thaw in their relations, reversing the long-standing chill on the Korean Peninsula. The recent developments may seem baffling to some people, but are actually within the bounds of reason. During the Winter Games, the DPRK did not conduct any nuclear or missile test and the US and the ROK suspended their joint exercises targeting the DPRK. This proves that China's "suspension for suspension" proposal was the right prescription for the problem and created basic conditions for the improvement of inter-Korean relations.
> 
> The Korean Peninsula issue has finally taken an important step in the right direction. China fully commends and supports the efforts made by the two Koreas. To return the Peninsula to peace and stability and the nuclear issue to the track of dialogue, these initial steps must be followed up by corresponding and concerted efforts by the parties. To this end, we call on the parties, particularly the US and the DPRK, to engage in dialogue sooner rather than later. We encourage all to follow the dual-track approach of remaining committed to the goal of denuclearization and working actively to establish a peace mechanism on the Peninsula. The parties' legitimate security concerns, including those of the DPRK, can be addressed in exchange for and in tandem with progress towards denuclearization. This is China's long-standing position and also the vision set forth in the relevant Security Council resolutions.
> 
> Of course, it takes more than one cold day to freeze three feet of ice. Despite light at the end of the tunnel, the journey ahead won't be smooth. History has reminded us time and again that whenever tensions subsided on the Peninsula, the situation would be clouded by various interferences. Now is a crucial moment for testing the sincerity of the parties. Every effort must be made for peace, and the opportunity must be seized. It falls to all parties to bear in mind the imperative of peace and the well-being of people in the region. All must demonstrate political courage and make a political decision to expeditiously carry out all necessary and useful engagements, both bilateral and plurilateral, and to do their best to restart dialogue and negotiation for the peaceful settlement of the nuclear issue. China will continue to make unremitting efforts for this outcome.
> 
> 	
> China Central Television: In the last five years, President Xi has been fully engaged in China's foreign policy. His personal diplomacy has enhanced China's standing and international influence like never before. How do you see the role and impact of the diplomacy conducted by President Xi as head of state?
> 
> Wang Yi: Head-of-state diplomacy as the highest form of state-to-state interaction plays a pivotal role and has irreplaceable strategic value. Since 2012, President Xi Jinping has been the chief architect of China's distinctive major-country diplomacy. He was personally involved in the planning and conduct of head-of-state diplomacy, which by all accounts has been brilliant. To date, President Xi has visited 57 countries in different parts of the world and received more than 110 foreign heads of state. These important visits and meetings go a long way towards deepening the world's understanding of China, enhancing China's profile and influence, and facilitating the solution of many global problems. President Xi's leadership and charisma has earned him – and his country – many good friends among foreign leaders who represent a diverse range of cultures and social systems.
> 
> In the year ahead, President Xi will host the four diplomatic events I mentioned earlier, and he will also attend the BRICS Summit in South Africa, the APEC Economic Leaders' Meeting in Papua New Guinea and the G20 Summit in Argentina. We believe that President Xi's personal diplomacy will make a positive and responsible contribution to the well-being of his people, the interests of China and the welfare of the world. It will write a whole new chapter of major-country diplomacy with Chinese characteristics in the new era.
> 
> 		
> Bloomberg: The US says it will use all available tools to prevent China from undermining international competition. Will China respond in kind?
> 
> Wang Yi: Let me first reiterate China's policy towards the United States. China and the US are agreed that we share broad interests and important responsibilities for global peace, stability and prosperity. Our two countries are to carry out broad-based cooperation on the basis of mutual benefit, manage our differences on the basis of mutual respect, deepen mutual understanding and friendship between our people, and work together to address major regional and global challenges. We ought to work for the sustained, healthy and steady growth of our relations.
> 
> Cooperation is the main thrust of China-US relations. Our people enjoy close and extensive exchanges. According to the latest Gallup poll, more than 50 percent of Americans have a favorable view of China, the highest rate in nearly three decades. I hope people will pay more attention to such positive things. As the largest developing country and developed country, China and America working together will benefit not just our own countries, but also the whole world. If there is any competition between us, which is natural, it has to be healthy and positive. We may have competition, but we don't have to be rivals. Instead, we should strive to be partners.
> 
> China is determined to stay on the path it has chosen, and China's development and revitalization is unstoppable. This is the consensus of the international community. Some Americans allege that China will replace America's role in the world. This strategic conclusion is fundamentally wrong. China is on the path of socialism with distinctive Chinese characteristics. Its success is underpinned by its commitment to peaceful development and win-win cooperation. China's path is completely different from that of traditional powers and, as such, is commended and welcomed by a growing number of countries. The truth is, the more China develops, the more contribution it can make to the world. China is on a long march to modernization. It has no need or intention to displace America. China and America must respect each other, combine our strengths and pursue win-win cooperation on the basis of the three joint communiqués and our common understandings. China-US relations have gone through a lot in the past few decades, but dialogue and cooperation has always carried the day. It is the wise thing to do; there can be no alternative.
> 
> As for our trade frictions, history teaches that trade war is never the right solution. In a globalized world, it is particularly unhelpful, as it will harm the initiator as well as the target country. In the event of a trade war, China will make a justified and necessary response. The bottom line is, as the world's largest economies, China's and America's interests are deeply entwined. We must bear in mind not just the interests of our own people, but also the well-being of the world. When all is said and done, we hope China and America will have a calm and constructive dialogue as equals, and find a win-win solution.
> 
> 
> 
> China Daily: We hear a view that China has abandoned its long-standing policy of non-interference in favor of a more interventionist approach. Are we seeing a new trend in China's foreign policy?
> 
> Wang Yi: As a permanent member of the UN Security Council, China takes seriously its responsibility for maintaining international peace. Even in the 1950s, we made an important contribution to the peaceful settlement of the Indochina issue. Today, China is in a much better position to help resolve various regional and international issues. We are ready to play our part; indeed, the world expects no less from us.
> 
> In helping to settle various flashpoints, we follow a distinctly Chinese approach. There are things we will do and there are things we won't do. Put simply, our approach is at once peaceful, justifiable and constructive. First, we prefer a political settlement of disputes through dialogue and negotiation, and firmly reject the use of force. Second, we respect other countries' sovereignty and wish, and never meddle in their internal affairs. Indeed, we firmly reject imposing one's own view on others. Third, we do our best to be fair and objective and proceed from the merits of the matter. We firmly reject pursuing private ends. Our approach is rooted in traditional Chinese culture and our successful diplomatic practice. In keeping with the purposes and principles of the UN Charter, it shows the right way and provides a good example for resolving conflicts and challenges in the world.
> 
> RIA Novosti: Russia's presidential election is scheduled for 18 March. What do you think the result is going to be? How does China view the prospects of China-Russia relations?
> 
> Wang Yi: The presidential election is of vital importance to Russia and its people. We note that President Putin has overseen important strides in Russia's development and he has strong support from his people. We trust the Russian people will again make the right choice and advance steadily towards national revitalization. The Russian people are resilient, principled and resistant to pressure. Our best wishes for Russia and the Russian people!
> 
> We have great confidence in the future of China-Russia relations. Our confidence comes from the strong friendship and trust between our presidents, which is fundamental to the further growth of our relationship. It also comes from the deepening of our cooperation in so many fields, our firm support for each other's core interests, our close coordination on international affairs and the growing exchanges between our two societies. In short, the China-Russia comprehensive strategic partnership of coordination is as unshakable as a mountain. I ask you to convey this to our friends in Russia: the sky is the limit for Sino-Russian cooperation, and we must continue to make the relationship even better than it already is.
> 
> 	
> Global Times: China's influence has been on the rise across the board. The 19th Party Congress gives Chinese people greater expectations about their future. However, some in the world are again trying to paint China as a threat. How would you counter this claim?
> 
> Wang Yi: For decades, the West has made all kinds of assessments and predictions about China. To some Westerners, China is either "collapsing" or "threatening". As China continues to grow, the first theory has collapsed and become an international laughing stock. Meanwhile, proponents of the second theory have conjured up new versions, which find dwindling support because facts speak louder than words.
> 
> What are the facts? For years, China has been the leading engine of global growth. At more than 30 percent, China's annual contribution is bigger than that of America, Japan and the Eurozone combined. China accounts for more than 70 percent of poverty reduction worldwide, a miracle in human history. As the largest source of peacekeeping personnel among the permanent members of the Security Council and the second largest contributor to the UN peacekeeping budget, China is bearing a weighty responsibility for maintaining world peace. Not to mention that in the last five years, with its Belt and Road Initiative and other major proposals, China has come to the fore in championing global governance, free trade and an open global economy.
> 
> From these solid facts, those who do not have bias or practice double standards will see in China not a threat, but plenty of opportunities. It's time the "China threat theory" was laid to rest.
> 
> Kazinform: Since its launch five years ago, the Belt and Road Initiative has made a lot of progress. However, some Westerners seem to harbor doubts about its transparency and conformity with international rules. What is China's response?
> 
> Wang Yi: The Belt and Road is a transparent initiative launched by China. It follows the "golden rule" of extensive consultation, joint contribution and shared benefits. Belt and Road cooperation aims to be equal-footed, inclusive and beneficial to all. The planning and implementation of BRI projects have been discussed by the participants in the open. No country is dominating the process; all parties have an equal say. There is no back-room deal; everything is transparent. There is no "winner takes all"; every project delivers win-win results.
> 
> Last May, the representatives of more than 140 countries participated in the Belt and Road Forum for International Cooperation. The turnout is a clear vote of confidence from the international community. To date, more than 80 countries and international organizations have signed BRI agreements with China. A large number of BRI projects are well underway and adding needed momentum to the economic and social development of our partner countries. For example, China is building over a dozen power stations for Pakistan, the largest of which is supplying electricity to tens of millions of Pakistanis. When all of them are completed, power cuts and shortages will be a thing of the past in Pakistan. In Serbia, a Chinese enterprise bought a troubled steel mill and turned it around in less than a year, both saving more than 5,000 local jobs and helping to re-energize the city in which the steel mill is located. In Greece, a Chinese group took over the operation of its largest seaport, ramped up the container volume and put it back in the same league as Europe's largest ports. China is also partnering with France to build a nuclear power plant in the UK, a stellar example of high-tech cooperation under the BRI.
> 
> As a global public good, the BRI of course abides by international rules. As a platform for international cooperation, it naturally follows market principles. The joint communiqué of last year's forum committed to this and emphasized the importance of economic, social, fiscal and environmental sustainability of projects. We sincerely ask for ideas from all parties, so that we will together make a success of the Belt and Road Initiative. Our goal is not only to strengthen the physical connectivity of infrastructure, but also to improve the institutional connectivity of policies, rules and standards. BRI projects must be high-standard as well as results-oriented, high-quality as well as economically viable, beneficial to the world as well as to China.
> 
> 
> 		
> Beijing TV: Premier Li Keqiang emphasized in his government work report that 2018 will kick off efforts to put the decisions of the 19th Party Congress into action. It is the 40th anniversary of reform and opening-up, and a crucial year for securing a decisive victory in establishing a moderately prosperous society in all respects and for implementing the 13th Five-Year Plan. What will the Ministry of Foreign Affairs do in 2018 to facilitate China's development goals?
> 
> Wang Yi: China still being a developing country, facilitating domestic development is part and parcel of major-country diplomacy with Chinese characteristics. Keeping in mind our new mission and what is expected of us, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs will implement the decisions of the central leadership and be more active in facilitating domestic development.
> 
> We will adapt to the new landscape of high-quality development to create a more favorable environment for external cooperation, including "bringing in" and "going global", and for domestic development.
> 
> We will tackle the new challenges presented by the evolution of the principal contradiction facing Chinese society. To tell China's stories in a more compelling way, we will both upgrade the presentation of Chinese provinces and launch a new series on the major initiatives of reform and opening-up. For example, later this year we will host an event to present the Xiongan New Area to the world. In addition, the MFA has been and will continue to be fully engaged in poverty alleviation and do its bit for winning the nationwide battle against poverty.
> 
> We will meet the new requirements and leverage our diplomatic and consular assets across the globe to facilitate the Belt and Road Initiative and protect China's overseas interests.
> 
> All in all, in advancing major-country diplomacy with Chinese characteristics in the new era, we aim to be not just the pacesetter of China's international engagement, but also a solid contributor to domestic development.
> 
> The Paper: This year marks the 15th anniversary of the strategic partnership between China and ASEAN. How will China take forward the relationship?
> 
> Wang Yi: As we celebrate the 15th anniversary, 2018 is of particular importance for the future of China-ASEAN strategic partnership.
> 
> The last 15 years have seen China-ASEAN cooperation go from strength to strength and bear rich fruits. For nine years running, China has been ASEAN's largest trading partner. Last year, our trade exceeded 500 billion dollars and two-way visits totaled 40 million, all of which brought real benefits to our combined population of nearly 2 billion. Indeed, China-ASEAN cooperation is the most successful and dynamic in the Asian-Pacific region.
> 
> In the year ahead, we will continue to give the highest priority to cooperation with ASEAN, upgrade our strategic partnership and build a more close-knit community of shared destiny. We have three priorities. First, we will work out a new blueprint of cooperation. The proposed China-ASEAN Strategic Partnership Vision 2030 will lead to better coordination between the Belt and Road Initiative and ASEAN's development plans. Second, we will foster new highlights of cooperation. Cooperation will be broadened in the political and security, economic and trade, and social and people-to-people areas, with more projects and outcomes in the pipeline. Third, we will forge new platforms of cooperation. Efforts will be made to build a Lancang-Mekong economic development belt, establish a cooperation framework with the East ASEAN Growth Area, support ASEAN community-building, and conclude the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership as soon as possible.

> The Straits Times: The South China Sea is calm now, but there are still concerns over reports of China's continuing militarization of its islands in the South China Sea. Are the talks with ASEAN countries for a code of conduct likely to be completed this year?
> 
> Wang Yi: When it comes to maintaining peace and stability in the South China Sea, China's resolve is as strong as its commitment is deep. China's approach to the South China Sea issue is a responsible one that takes into account the interests of the Chinese people, the facts of history, the imperative of regional peace and the international rule of law. This position is firm and consistent.
> 
> With situation in the South China Sea turning for the better, China and ASEAN countries face a golden opportunity. We all agree to develop a code of conduct in the South China Sea to preserve its hard-won tranquility. Last week, our officials held an inaugural round of consultation on the COC text and made encouraging progress. At least three more rounds have been envisaged for the remainder of this year. China and ASEAN countries are willing and able to draft regional rules on our own, rules which will meet our region's imperatives and be adhered to by all.
> 
> There are also challenges in the South China Sea. Some outside forces are not happy with the prevailing calm and try to stir up trouble and muddle the waters. Their frequent show of force with fully-armed aircraft and naval vessels is the most destabilizing factor for peace and stability in our region.
> 
> It is useful to heed the wisdom of a Chinese verse, "Green hills cannot stop the river flowing; to the vast ocean it keeps advancing." In the year ahead, China will work with ASEAN countries to seize the opportunity, broaden cooperation, prevent interference and overcome challenges. Cherishing what we have worked so hard to achieve, China and ASEAN countries will speed up the COC consultation, actively explore a mechanism of cooperation among the coastal states, and promote peace and cooperation in the South China Sea.
> 
> China Global Television Network: In 2018, for the very first time in 12 years, the Forum on China-Africa Cooperation will once again be hosted by China. What outcome do you expect from that summit? I am also wondering how China stays true to its policy on honesty and amicability towards Africa in the new era?
> 
> Wang Yi: General Secretary Xi Jinping once made a powerful statement: "China and Africa are friends tested by adversity. Such friends must never be forgotten." So be assured: no matter how the world may change or what others may say, the profound friendship between China and Africa will remain unbreakable, and China's promise of sincerity, real results, friendship and good faith will remain true.
> 
> As Africa's brother and partner, China will always attach particular importance to the needs and interests of African countries. Africa's concerns are China's concerns, and its priorities are China's priorities. Africa faces the twin challenges of maintaining peace and security and of promoting development and revitalization. In response to its needs, China will step up mediation in regional flashpoints. China will also enhance cooperation with African countries on unconventional security threats such as terrorism, piracy and natural disaster, and help them build capacity for ensuring their own peace and security.
> 
> In our new endeavor to build a global community with a shared future, Africa is an indispensable partner. China welcomes our African brothers and sisters to continue their ride on China's fast train of development. The FOCAC summit scheduled for September will bring together Chinese and African leaders again, 12 years after their last gathering in Beijing. They will discuss China-Africa cooperation in the new era and focus on jointly advancing the Belt and Road Initiative and turning China and Africa into a community with a shared future. By aligning the Belt and Road Initiative with the UN's 2030 Agenda, the AU's Agenda 2063 and the development strategies of individual African countries, we will give wings to China-Africa cooperation to help it soar to greater heights.

> Kyodo News: This year marks the 40th anniversary of the China-Japan Treaty of Peace and Friendship. Will we see an exchange of visits between Chinese and Japanese leaders? How do you see the future of China-Japan relations?
> 
> Wang Yi: In the recent period, Japan has adopted a clearer and more positive policy towards China, resulting in a precious improvement of relations. China welcomes this. If Japan does not prevaricate, flip-flop or backpedal, and instead comes to terms with China's development and welcomes it, China will be willing to act in the same spirit and work with Japan to put our relationship back on the track of healthy and steady growth.
> 
> Forty years ago, China and Japan signed the Treaty of Peace and Friendship. It codified the political principles agreed in negotiating the normalization of Sino-Japanese relations, including handling history correctly and following the one-China policy. The treaty also enshrined our joint desire to live in peace and friendship forever. As a saying goes, never forget why you started, and you can accomplish your mission. Forty years on, at another crucial juncture of history, we hope Japan will have political credibility and act accordingly to cement the political foundation of our relations and give effect to the political understanding that "China and Japan see each other as partners, not threats". I am hopeful that with the steady improvement of our relations, high-level visits will naturally come about, and peace and friendship will again be the dominant theme of China-Japan relations.
> 
> Phoenix TV: What is China's view on the "Indo-Pacific strategy" pursued by the US, Japan, India and Australia? Do you see it as an attempt to "contain" China?
> 
> Wang Yi: It seems there is never a shortage of headline-grabbing ideas. They are like the sea foam in the Pacific or Indian Ocean: they may get some attention, but soon will dissipate. Contrary to the claim made by some academics and media outlets that the "Indo-Pacific strategy" aims to contain China, the four countries' official position is that it targets no one. I hope they mean what they say and their action will match their rhetoric. Nowadays, stoking a new Cold War is out of sync with the times and inciting block confrontation will find no market.
> 
> 		
> Press Trust of India: Last year has been a very difficult one in India-China relations. How do you see India-China relations shaping up this year?
> 
> Wang Yi: Despite some tests and difficulties, the China-India relationship continues to grow. In the process, China has both upheld its legitimate rights and interests and taken care to preserve the relationship. Chinese and Indian leaders have developed a strategic vision for the future of our relations: the Chinese "dragon" and the Indian "elephant" must not fight each other, but dance with each other. In that case, one plus one will equal not only two, but also eleven.
> 
> The international situation is experiencing its biggest change in a century. More and more far-sighted people have come to realize that as the largest two developing countries become modernized – each with a population of more than one billion – China and India must do everything to empathize with and support each other and to avoid mutual suspicion and attrition. In this sense, mutual trust is the most precious commodity in China-India relations. With political trust, not even the Himalayas can stop us from strengthening friendly exchanges; without it, not even level land can bring us together. Let me put this to our Indian friends: our shared understandings far outstrip our differences and our common interests far outweigh our frictions. China is willing and ready to inherit and take forward our traditional friendship and be a friend and partner of the Indian people. I hope the two sides will be free from mental inhibitions and meet each other halfway. Let us replace suspicion with trust, manage differences through dialogue, and build a future through cooperation.
> 
> China Radio International: The 11 countries that make up the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership are expected to sign it today, and the CPTPP may take effect next year at the earliest. What is your thought on this?
> 
> Wang Yi: China is not a party to the CPTPP. However, China has been a strong advocate of trade liberalization and a key player of Asia-Pacific cooperation and economic integration. In 2014, China persuaded APEC economies to kick off in Beijing the process of establishing a Free Trade Area of the Asia-Pacific. China has also been working actively for the conclusion of the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership, a free trade pact that will cover more populations and involve more diverse economies than any similar initiative. China is positive about any open, transparent and inclusive arrangement that reinforces regional economic integration and a WTO-centered global free trade system, be it RCEP or CPTPP. We hope to see better communication, coordination and interaction between the various free trade initiatives in our region, so that they may complement one another, help resist trade protectionism and contribute to a more open global economy.
>

> Radio France: Do you think France could give a new direction to China-EU relations?
> 
> Wang Yi: This year will mark the 15th anniversary of the China-EU comprehensive strategic partnership. The year started with President Macron paying a state visit to China and Sino-French relations in excellent shape. Then the visit of Prime Minister May kicked off efforts by China and the UK to upgrade their "Golden Era" of relations. We hope at the end of the year, China-EU relations will be as strong as we have started it. We hope France will make a substantial contribution to the furtherance of China-EU cooperation. Global governance has emerged as a new dimension of such cooperation, China and the EU have a joint responsibility to safeguard the global free trade system, and negotiation needs to be speeded up to conclude a China-EU investment agreement.
> 
> There are also some disagreements between China and the EU. But both sides have realized the need to put oneself in the other's shoes and to be more open, tolerant and understanding of each other. China has always appreciated the importance of Europe. We support European integration and have confidence in Europe's future. Given all the uncertainty around us, China is ready to partner with Europe to provide more stability and make the world a better place.
> 
> China News Service: Chinese people are speaking favorably of the consular assistance and protection they are getting, but they also expect more to be done. At the same time, there are appeals for a more rational understanding of consular service. What is your view?
> 
> Wang Yi: Consular assistance and protection seems to be a must-have question at my annual press conference. Indeed, it potentially concerns the interests and well-being of every Chinese and their family. Making a good job of it is the unshirkable responsibility of the foreign service.
> 
> Last year, as many as 130 million mainlanders traveled overseas. Given the growing magnitude of their consular needs, we adopted a people-centered approach and built a system for ensuring their safety which consists of six pillars, namely, legal provisions, institution building, risk assessment, early warning, awareness raising and emergency response. In 2017, the MFA handled more than 70,000 cases of consular assistance and protection, including evacuating Chinese tourists stranded by the erupting volcano on Bali, Indonesia and getting our nationals to safety from hurricane-ravaged Dominica. The 12308 consular hotline handled 170,000 calls, 100,000 more than in 2016. Prevention is the best protection. Last year, the MFA issued more than 1,000 travel advisories, which significantly reduced our citizens' risk exposure even before they traveled abroad.
> 
> As China develops and interacts more with the world, the social etiquette and civility of its citizens are being enhanced. Nowadays they are more inclined to protect China's reputation as well as their own rights. This new awareness has made our job easier.
> 
> In 2018, we will further improve the system for ensuring the safety of Chinese nationals abroad. Here I have three pieces of good news for you:
> 
> First, the MFA is working on draft legislation on consular protection and assistance. Public consultation will begin after the close of the NPC and CPPCC sessions. We welcome your input and suggestions.
> 
> Second, in addition to a dedicated website, the WeChat version of 12308 and the "China Consular Affairs" account on Weibo, we will soon launch the 12308 smartphone app to make consular services more accessible to the people.
> 
> Third, as from tomorrow, our diplomatic and consular missions around the world will slash consular legalization fees by as much as two-thirds. The fee reduction is expected to save Chinese citizens and businesses more than 10 million yuan every year.
>

> 
> TASS: What does China hope to accomplish at the Qingdao Summit it will host?
> 
> Wang Yi: The Shanghai Cooperation Organization was born in China, and the Qingdao Summit will be the first one after the SCO admitted new members. We welcome the SCO back to China and expect it to embark on a new journey in Qingdao. China looks forward to working with other members to achieve three goals at the summit:
> 
> First, making the SCO more cohesive. The Shanghai Spirit of mutual trust, mutual benefit and equal-footed consultation encapsulates the founding principle of our Organization. China will work with other members to uphold this spirit, enhance trust and solidarity, and build a more close-knit SCO community of shared future.
> 
> Second, making the SCO more effective. Our organization is driven by results-oriented, efficient and mutually beneficial cooperation. China will work with other members to promote its all-round development, including developing a five-year outline for the implementation of the Treaty on Long-term Good-neighborliness, Friendship and Cooperation, concluding or ratifying a number of resolutions or documents concerning our security, economic, environmental and cultural cooperation, and advancing Belt and Road projects in SCO member states.
> 
> Third, making the SCO more influential. Our Organization has a bounden duty to maintain peace and stability in our region and beyond. China will work with other members to help it meet international expectations, take a clearer stand on major international and regional issues, and play a more active role in regional cooperation and global economic governance.
> 
> To sum up, we will make the Qingdao Summit a new milestone in the development of the SCO and launch this new type of regional organization into a new era.
> 
> China Review News: Following the example of Gambia as well as São Tomé and Príncipe, Panama decided last year to switch diplomatic relations from Taipei to Beijing. Will Taiwan face "an avalanche of ruptured diplomatic ties", as its media have feared?
> 
> Wang Yi: There is only one China in the world and Taiwan is an inseparable part of China. This has been the consensus of the international community for decades. Adhering to the one-China principle and not having official ties with Taiwan has become a generally observed norm in international relations. It is obviously a correct choice in line with the tide of history to establish diplomatic relations and carry out regular cooperation with the government of the People's Republic of China, the sole legal representative of the whole of China. Such a choice would best serve the immediate and long-term interests of the countries and peoples in question. Of course it is the trend of the future, and no one can stop it.
> 
> The key to unlocking the cross-Straits stalemate lies in recognizing the 1992 Consensus and acknowledging that the two sides of the Taiwan Straits belong to one and the same China. The party that has locked the door must unlock it. The Taiwan authorities should return to the 1992 Consensus as soon as possible. This correct move will usher in a bright future for the peaceful development of cross-Straits relations.
> 
> 
> 
> Agencia EFE: The United States warned Latin American countries about the growing Chinese influence in the region. What is your response?
> 
> Wang Yi: China and Latin American countries are helping and supporting each other as fellow developing countries. Our cooperation does not target or seek to replace anyone, and China is not going to move anyone's "cheese", so to speak. China's cooperation with the region has grown rapidly because it suits its needs, improves lives there and boosts its capacity for self-driven growth. During the last five years, President Xi has visited Latin America and the Caribbean three times, taking in ten countries. Our cooperation has deepened, expanded and moved up the value chain. China has become a key trading partner for many in the hemisphere. Chinese businesses and investors have created more than 1.8 million local jobs. The Chinese saying "nothing, not even mountains or oceans, can separate those with a shared goal" aptly describes the state of our relations with Latin America and the Caribbean. The vast Pacific Ocean binds us together, making us partners in cooperation, whatever may stand between us.
> 
> Xinhua News Agency: In his report to the 19th Party Congress, General Secretary Xi called for making all-round efforts in the pursuit of major-country diplomacy with Chinese characteristics, and for building a new type of international relations and a global community with a shared future. How do you envisage China's distinctive major-country diplomacy going forward?
> 
> Wang Yi: In his report to the 19th Party Congress, General Secretary Xi Jinping emphasized that the Communist Party of China will strive for both the well-being of the Chinese people and human progress. To make new and greater contributions for humanity is our Party's abiding mission.
> 
> A committed and responsible China will adopt a more visionary foreign policy. While securing an enabling environment for its own development, China will be concerned with the welfare of humanity and partner with other countries to build a global community of shared future. Our vision is to forge a new type of international relations that features mutual respect, fairness, justice and win-win cooperation and to build an open, inclusive, clean and beautiful world that enjoys lasting peace, universal security and common prosperity.
> 
> We will have a broader mind. No matter what stage of development it reaches, China will stand for the equality of all countries, large or small, and will respect different civilizations and systems. China will put the greater good before its self-interest, and oppose the practice of the big and strong bullying the small and weak. China will stand up for small and weak countries, and help less developed countries achieve better growth.
> 
> And we will play a more active role. China will strive to meet growing international expectations and approach global governance on the basis of extensive consultation, joint contribution and shared benefits. China will be more active in helping to reform and improve the global governance system, find more constructive ways to settle regional and international issues by political means, and forge more effective partnerships to address various global challenges.
> 
> An ancient Chinese classic teaches that "when justice prevails, the world will be one community". We are determined to uphold our country's sovereignty and dignity. We are determined to be on the side of international justice and human progress. We are determined to build world peace, contribute to global prosperity and uphold the international order.
